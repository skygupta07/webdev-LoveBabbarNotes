<!-- The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It is used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes), A better way to use it when no other semantic element is available.

The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is mandatory to close the tag. The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by itself. span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag. -->
